### Some useful functional pieces of code. ###

Don't be surprised to see some dirty tricks (inline styles, javascript inside html files..), these are simply code snippets to remember how to do useful stuff, but not intended to be directly copy-pasted into real code.

* testdnd.html: native upload of files with drag and drop from desktop.
* waypoints.html: trigger events on scrolling with jquery-waypoints plugin.
